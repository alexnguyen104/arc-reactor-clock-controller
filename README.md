# Arc reactor clock controller
- The controller is based on Flask
- The clock and arduino code is based on <b>jeje95</b> product on Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6063303)
- However, I did change a bit inside the code so as to connect to the local Flask server
- To use this, please install the included libraries:

for Python
```
pip install flask
```
for Arduino, just follow most of <b>jeje95</b>'s instructions (I used different library to manipulate JSON so please check the source code)
